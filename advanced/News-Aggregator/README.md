## Description ##

News aggregator is a Django project to scrape a news website using Beautiful soup and request module and hence combination of web crawlers and web applications. 
Both of these technologies have their implementation in Python. 

## Features ##
Our news aggregator works in 3 steps:<br>
1.It scrapes the news website for the articles.In this Django project, we are scraping a website 'www.theonion.com'<br> 
(We have scraped news articles from 'latest' section of 'www.theonion.com' for demonstration)<br>
2.Then it stores the articleâ€™s images, links, and title.<br>
3.The stored objects in the database are served to the client. The client gets information in a nice template by clicking the 'Load news' button<br>
